**Troubleshooting Tips**

_**Any Tips for moving headset from CLS to patient? It seems we need to avoid rotating the headset when switching from person to patient.**_\


Rotating the headset while moving it from one person/place to another does rotate the game-world. The solution to this is to Press & Hold the Menu Button for 3 seconds to 'recenter' the game-world. The Menu Button is the concave button (w/ Pico Logo) on the controller, and on the side of the headset. A short-press allows users to return to the main menu, but a long-press will Recenter the user to be facing the correct direction.

Rather than worry about rotating the headset or not, just plan to press that Menu Button to recenter the user each time it's placed on a new person. .

_**Most of the time it switches to black and white mode and we have to restart to get out of that mode.**_

The black and white mode is directly related to the two external cameras on the front of the headset. They take photos of the real world to track movement within the VR world. When they are either covered by hands or the headset being laid flat face-down on a table for a long time, that black & white mode (tracking error) occurs. The solution to that error is to press the White Oval-Shaped button on the side of the headset. This will reset the tracking issue w/o having to restart the headset.

If you turn on the headset before putting on the disposable facepad, it is very easy to trigger that black & white tracking error mode, since most users place the headset face-down on a table to put on the face pad. I recommend putting on the facepads _first_ and then turning on the headset once it is in a normal position with the front cameras not being covered.

Finally, another potential cause of the b\&w tracking issue can occur if the front-facing external cameras are pointed directly at a bright light or a mirror or window. That can prevent them from finding a reference point for tracking. Again, if this happens, press the white oval-shaped button on the side of the headset.

**Also a few times it shows clouds when they lay down in the MRI.**

This is a new one for me. My hunch is that when users lay flat, they may be 'laying down too deep into the bed' and clipping through the virtual world. This is likely due to not recentering the headset once giving it to the patient--- this would place them much lower in the virtual world, allowing them to clip through. Please be sure to hold the Menu Button down for 3 seconds once giving the headset to a patient.

If a user finds themselves looking at the clouds, please press the menu button for 3 seconds and it should re-center them to the correct position.
