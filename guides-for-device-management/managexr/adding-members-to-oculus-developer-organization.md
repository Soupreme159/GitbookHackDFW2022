# Adding Members to Oculus Developer Organization

**Adding Members to Oculus Developer Organization**

**Step 1: Log into the** [innovation@childrens.com](mailto:innovation@childrens.com) **Oculus Developer Dashboard**

* On one browser, log into the [innovation@childrens.com](mailto:innovation@childrens.com) Facebook account
  * [innovation@childrens.com](mailto:innovation@childrens.com)
  * Innov84kids!
* Then, go to the Oculus Developer log in.
  * [https://auth.oculus.com/login/?redirect\_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.oculus.com%2Fmanage%2F](https://auth.oculus.com/login/?redirect\_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.oculus.com%2Fmanage%2F)
  * Log in via Facebook (the [innovation@childrens.com](mailto:innovation@childrens.com) account)
* It will redirect you back to Facebook once you click “Log in as Innovation”. Click “Continue as Innovation”.

**Step 2: Invite the Oculus account to be a member of the Developer Organization**

**Step 3: Accept the invite from the other Oculus account that you are trying to add**

* On a separate browser (you can use a different window, but you will have to log out of the innovation@childrens.com Developer account, then log in as the other account), log into Facebook as the account that you are trying to add as a member.
* Then, open the Oculus Developer log in site again, but make sure you are not logged in as [innovation@childrens.com](mailto:innovation@childrens.com).
  * [https://auth.oculus.com/login/?redirect\_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.oculus.com%2Fmanage%2F](https://auth.oculus.com/login/?redirect\_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.oculus.com%2Fmanage%2F)
* Log into the Oculus account that you are trying to add as a member.
* Then, in a different window, log into the email inbox of the account that you are trying to add as a member. You will see an email containing the invite to join the developer organization.
  * ![](../../.gitbook/assets/2)
* Click ‘View Invitation’, and it should redirect you to the Oculus Developer site again. Ensure that you are logged into the account that you are trying to add as a member, and not the Innovation account.
* Accept the invitation. This account will now be part of the Innovation Oculus Developer Organization.
