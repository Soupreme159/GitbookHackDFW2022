**Step 1:** Ensure that Software Asset Management (SAM) has actually purchased the app(s) for the specific clinic that requested it.

* Go on Service Now & enter the ticket number for the app request.
* Check to see that the ticket was marked as Closed / Complete.
* Once you have confirmed that the app was purchased for the specific clinic’s Oculus account, proceed to Step 2.

**Step 2:** Log onto Facebook & the Oculus website using the clinic’s Oculus account.

* Go on the Facebook website & log in using the clinic’s Oculus account log in information.
* Then, log into the Oculus website via Facebook.
  * [https://auth.oculus.com/login/](https://auth.oculus.com/login/)
* Ensure that this is the account that requested the certain app & is receiving it.

**Step 3:** Log onto the clinic Oculus account email inbox (Protonmail / Outlook).

* Go on Protonmail or Outlook to log onto the email tied to the clinic’s Oculus account (see the log in info above).
* Make sure that you open the Protonmail website for all of the PM\&R clinics’ emails, besides Cityville. For the Cityville email, you will open the Outlook website.
  * \*\* This may change to become standardized in the future.
* Also make sure that you use the exact email addresses as listen above. Some email addresses have 5’s in place of the ‘s’ in Children’s.

**Step 4:** Find the email with the gifted app.

* Locate the email containing the gifted app in the inbox.
* It should look like this:
  * ![](../.gitbook/assets/0)
* Click on ‘Redeem Gift’. It should take you to the Oculus website.
* The code should auto-populate when you click on “Redeem gift” on the app’s page. Ensure that the auto-populated code matches the code in the email.
* Once you click Redeem, a message should pop up saying “Added to VR Library”.
* It is then ready for the clinic to install on their headset.
