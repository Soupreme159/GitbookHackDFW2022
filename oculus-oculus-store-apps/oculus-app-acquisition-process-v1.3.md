**Preventing Business Owner team from installing free Oculus apps:**

Temporary process: Innovation Lab Director has informed Business Owners that staff are NOT allowed to install any apps from Oculus store outside of the process above.

Potential Process (Innovation Lab tested successfully on test device; deploying and testing at PM\&R clinics in Q3 and will update this process document)

1. After approval to install, **Innovation Lab Analyst** adds Oculus app to PM\&R’s ManageXR Department Homepage\
   ManageXR Homepage replaces the default Oculus Store homepage and only shows apps approved by IT

**Preventing Patients from installing free oculus apps:**

ALL Oculus headsets are used under supervision of a Children’s employee.
