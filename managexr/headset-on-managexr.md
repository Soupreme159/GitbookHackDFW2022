# Headset on ManageXR

**Steps to Register VR Headset on ManageXR**

**IT Service Desk will fulfill these steps once they receive a new ticket to register a headset on ManageXR.**

**Items you will need to register the Oculus headset on ManageXR:**

* Charged headset & controllers
* A phone with the Facebook and Oculus apps installed (& logged into the clinic’s Oculus account)
  * \*\* The Innovation Lab Specialist can provide you the clinic’s Oculus account information
* A computer with the ManageXR Device Setup Tool installed & open (having the site for the Oculus developer dashboard open may help as well if the account logged into your phone is not linked to a developer organization)
* The USB-C cable for the headset to connect to your computer (ensure your computer is compatible with this cable)

**Step 1: Factory reset the device.**

* Power off the headset if it is not already off
  * Hold down the power button on the right side of the headset, wait for a menu to pop up.
  * Click ‘Power Off’
* Hold down the power button + the volume down button (the left side of the button on the bottom of the headset) at the same time.
* A menu will pop up. Release the power button and use the volume buttons to scroll up / down. Select ‘Factory Reset’ using the power button. Then, select “Yes, erase and factory reset”

**Step 2: Pair the headset with the phone & on the Oculus app, turn on Developer Mode.**

* The phone will need the Facebook and Oculus apps installed.
  * First, log onto the clinic’s Oculus account on Facebook.
  * Once the account is logged onto Facebook, open the Oculus app. You can log into the Oculus app via the Facebook account.
* Turn the headset on. You do not need to go through the full setting up process on the headset, just turn it on for this part. Just wait / click the next steps until you can see a number code at the top within the headset.
* On the Oculus app on your phone, ensure that the headset is connected.
* Three methods of connecting the headset to the phone:
  * If the headset is turned on and near your mobile device, it may pair automatically.
  * Menu > Devices > click on the ‘+’ at the top right & type in the code that can be seen in the headset once it is turned on.
  * Menu > Devices > click on the drop-down bar at the top of the page > connect the headset if the correct headset can be seen in this drop-down bar
* Once the headset is connected, scroll down & turn on Developer Mode.
* **(Innovation Lab Specialist)** The Oculus account associated with the headset should be linked to a developer account or part of a developer organization; see the documentation below:
  * [Adding Members to Oculus Developer Organization.docx](https://dallaschildrens.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/InnovationTeam/EcfBCEaAKnJCi-eS9tc-l7IBhPuxWXK1eMLbn9d-0ECzrg?e=lFcRSm)
  * \*\* The 7 PM\&R clinic Oculus accounts have already been added to the developer organization; but the Rockwall account still needs to be verified as a Developer account.
* Once Developer Mode is enabled, the ManageXR Device Setup Tool can now recognize the headset when it is plugged into the computer (via USB-C cable + USB-C adapter).

**Step 3: Use the ManageXR Device Setup Tool on the computer to install ManageXR**

* Open the application on your computer, and connect the headset to your computer
* Once the device appears on the set-up tool, the status may appear as “Requires preparation”.
* Look in the headset and see if the special settings menu has popped up. If not, click “Refresh Device” on the ManageXR Device Setup Tool. This should make the special settings menu pop up on the headset.
* Scroll down on this pop up and click ‘Accounts’. Remove each account – it should be the Facebook and Oculus accounts that need to be removed.
* Click “Refresh Device” again on the ManageXR tool. It should give you the option to install ManageXR on the device. Click “Install”. After a short time, it should show on the computer tool that ManageXR has been installed.
* Let the Innovation Lab Specialist know the BAT number on the headset.

**Step 4: (Innovation Lab Specialist) Check the ManageXR dashboard to see that the headset shows up.**

* Innovation Lab Specialist: Log onto the ManageXR account.
* Navigate to ‘Devices’.
* The headset should show up named as its serial number (you can check this on the ManageXR Device Setup Tool). Rename the device as its BAT number.
