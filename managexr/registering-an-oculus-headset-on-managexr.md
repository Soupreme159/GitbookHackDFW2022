# Registering an Oculus Headset on ManageXR

**Steps to Register the Oculus VR Headset on ManageXR**

**IT Service Desk will fulfill these steps once they receive a new ticket to register a headset on ManageXR.**

**Items you will need to register your headset on ManageXR:**

* Charged headset & controllers
* A phone with the Facebook and Oculus apps installed (& logged into your Oculus account)
* A computer with the ManageXR Device Setup Tool installed & open (having the site for the Oculus developer dashboard open may help as well if the account logged into your phone is not linked to a developer organization)
* The cable for your headset to connect to your computer (ensure your computer is compatible with this cable)

**Step 1: Factory reset your device**

* Power off your headset if it is not already off
  * Hold down the power button on the right side of the headset, wait for a menu to pop up.
  * Click ‘Power Off’
* Hold down the power button + the volume down button (the left side of the button on the bottom of the headset) at the same time.
* A menu will pop up. Release the power button and use the volume buttons to scroll up / down. Select ‘Factory Reset’ using the power button. Then, select “Yes, erase and factory reset”

**Step 2: Set your mobile device (phone) on Developer Mode**

* The phone will have to have the Facebook and Oculus apps installed.
  * Log onto the Oculus account on Facebook.
  * Once the account is logged onto Facebook, you can log into the Oculus app via Facebook.
* On the Oculus app on your phone, ensure that your headset is connected.
  * If the headset is turned on and near your mobile device, it may pair automatically.
* Menu > Devices > click on the drop down bar at the top of the page > connect the headset
* Turn on Developer Mode once the headset is connected.
* Your account should be linked to a developer account or part of a developer organization; see the documentation below:

  * \*\* The 7 PM\&R clinic Oculus accounts have already been added to the developer organization.

**Step 3: Use the ManageXR Device Setup Tool on your computer to install ManageXR**

* Open the application on your computer, and connect your headset to your computer
* Once the device appears on the set-up tool, the status may appear as “Requires preparation”.
* Look in the headset and see if the special settings menu has popped up. If not, click “Refresh Device” on the ManageXR Device Setup Tool. This should make the special settings menu pop up.
* Scroll down on this pop up and click ‘Accounts’. Remove each account – it should be the Facebook and Oculus accounts.
* Click “Refresh Device” again on the ManageXR tool. It should give you the option to install ManageXR on the device. Click “Install”. After a short time, it should show on the computer tool that ManageXR has been installed

**Step 4: Check the ManageXR dashboard to see that your device shows up**

* Log onto your ManageXR account
* Navigate to ‘Devices’
* Your device should show up named as its serial number (you can check this on the ManageXR Device Setup Tool)
