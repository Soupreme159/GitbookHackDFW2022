# Submitting Tickets for Registering PM\&R Headsets

**Innovation / IT Services Process for Registering PM\&R (Oculus) Headsets & Setting Up Home Screen**

**Step 1:** Submit ticket for IT Representative to go on-site to clinic location

* **Example request:** “A representative is needed to go on-site to the Richardson Specialty Center to help register the Oculus headset on our management platform, ManageXR, and set up an app home screen on the clinic's Oculus headset. This home screen is necessary to ensure that the clinic staff / patients are only able to access the approved apps that are included on the home screen. A home screen is already made with the clinic's approved apps, we just need someone to help ensure that it is set up properly (I can help guide the rep / give instructions while the rep is on-site with the headset). Thanks!”
* **The IT Rep will need:**
  * The phone with Facebook & Oculus apps installed (Mobile Assets supplied us with an iPhone 128gb phone – this phone will be kept by the IT rep to complete the registering of the 7 PM\&R clinics, and then will be returned to Mobile Assets)
  * A PC with the ManageXR Device Setup Tool software: [https://help.managexr.com/en/articles/5924145-download-the-device-setup-tool](https://help.managexr.com/en/articles/5924145-download-the-device-setup-tool)
  * A USB-C adapter if their computer is not already compatible with USB-C - (the Oculus Headset plugs into the computer with a USB-C cable)

**Step 2:** Have the IT Rep go on-site to set up the headset, be on standby to assist if issues arise.

* Once the ticket has been approved and is in motion, coordinate a date with the IT Rep where Innovation Lab Specialist would be available to assist the IT Rep during the setting up of the headset.
* Also, reach out to the clinic contact & inform them of what will be happening. Make sure that the date & time works for them (ie: they will not be using the Oculus at that time, etc.)

  * **Example explanation:**
    * We are implementing a “home screen” on PM\&R Oculus headsets, and a representative from IT will visit your clinic on \_\_(date)\_\_ to help install the home screen with your apps on the headset. He is expected to arrive around \_\_\_\_\_. Please let me know if this time is not convenient for you.
* Innovation Lab Specialist should be on call with IT Rep to go through the process together.
* IT Rep should review this document to have an idea of what to do:

* IT Rep will first register the headset on ManageXR, according to the documentation above. Once the headset appears on ManageXR under ‘Devices’, the Innovation Lab Specialist
