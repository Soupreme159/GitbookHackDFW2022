# Submitting Tickets for Registering PM\&R Headsets1

**Innovation / IT Services Process for Registering PM\&R (Oculus) Headsets & Setting Up Home Screen**

**\*\* Note:** The Rockwall account still needs to be verified as a Developer account. Please verify it as a Developer account before sending the IT Rep to the location. Also check that the other accounts are verified (log onto Oculus Deverloper website for each of the clinic accounts & see if there is a verification notice).

**Step 1: Set up home screen for the particular clinic’s headset / apps via ManageXR.**

* Follow these steps for each clinic’s Oculus PRIOR to submitting a ticket for the IT Rep to visit the clinic:

* Once a home screen is completed for a clinic, a ticket can be submitted for that clinic’s headset to be set up.

**Step 2: Submit a ticket for IT Representative to go on-site to clinic location.**

* **Example request:** “A representative is needed to go on-site to the Richardson Specialty Center to help register the Oculus headset on our management platform, ManageXR, and set up an app home screen on the clinic's Oculus headset. This home screen is necessary to ensure that the clinic staff / patients are only able to access the approved apps that are included on the home screen. A home screen is already made with the clinic's approved apps, we just need someone to help ensure that it is set up properly (I can help guide the rep / give instructions while the rep is on-site with the headset). Thanks!”
* **The IT Rep will need:**
  * The phone with Facebook & Oculus apps installed (Mobile Assets supplied us with an iPhone 128gb phone – this phone will be kept by the IT rep to complete the registering of the 7 PM\&R clinics, and then will be returned to Mobile Assets)
  * A PC with the ManageXR Device Setup Tool software: [https://help.managexr.com/en/articles/5924145-download-the-device-setup-tool](https://help.managexr.com/en/articles/5924145-download-the-device-setup-tool)
  * A USB-C adapter if their computer is not already compatible with USB-C - (the Oculus Headset plugs into the computer with a USB-C cable)

  * The log-in information for the clinic’s Oculus account:

**Step 3: Have the IT Rep go on-site to set up the headset, be on standby to assist if issues arise.**

* Once the ticket has been approved and is in motion, coordinate a date with the IT Rep where Innovation Lab Specialist would be available to assist the IT Rep during the setting up of the headset.
* Also, reach out to the clinic contact & inform them of what will be happening. Make sure that the date & time works for them (ie: they will not be using the Oculus at that time, etc.)
  * **You can find the PM\&R Clinic contacts here:**
    * [PM\&R Clinic Contacts.docx](https://dallaschildrens.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/InnovationTeam/EVUo2u9WNNdLiHuT7Imt0OYB9ODZ6g40SmmX8-RQ2R-l6w?e=K9JEB1)
  * **Example email to clinic contact:**
    * We are implementing a “home screen” on PM\&R Oculus headsets, and a representative from IT will visit your clinic on \_\_(date)\_\_ to help install the home screen with your apps on the headset. He is expected to arrive around \_\_(time)\_\_. Please let me know if this time is not convenient for you.
* Innovation Lab Specialist should be on call with IT Rep WHILE rep is on-site to go through the process together.
* IT Rep should review this document to have an idea of what to do:
  * [Registering a Headset on ManageXR.docx](https://dallaschildrens.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/InnovationTeam/Ec4JztNrYGpInuNKoG5Lu7QBJe0GxVyv5Z7SRkE9T\_rDHg?e=YpjEVJ)
* IT Rep will first register the headset on ManageXR, according to the documentation above.
* Once ManageXR is successfully installed on the headset, the Device Set Up tool should say “Installed”. It should also show the device’s serial number.
* IT Rep should tell Innovation Lab specialist the **serial number**, as well as the **BAT Number** of the headset (the blue tag sticker on the top of the headset).

**Step 3: Innovation Lab Specialist should log onto ManageXR to complete the setting up of the home screen.**

* Innovation Lab Specialist should log onto the ManageXR account. Navigate to ‘Devices’; the newly-registered headset should appear as its serial number in the devices list. Click on the serial number of the newly- registered headset & rename the device name to its BAT number
  * The IT Rep using the headset can tell you the BAT number on the headset, OR the BAT numbers of the clinic headsets can be found here:
    * [\_VR, AR Inventory Tracker.xlsx](https://dallaschildrens.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/InnovationTeam/EZvrjeDbtVJOlwvJKXSTpnYBP8m\_rg2Z6Pm0yNVf\_JffDA?e=9oT4V9)
* After it is renamed to the BAT number, click on the Configuration drop down menu & add the device to the previously created configuration for that specific clinic. Reference Step 3 in this document:
  * [Creating a Homescreen Through ManageXR.docx](https://dallaschildrens.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/InnovationTeam/ERA9N6ciVT5Bkg102MwG9pIBE6erUrbjchwEKWDF7PAVXg?e=sUZHSn)
  * ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (2)>)

**Step 4: Ensure that the home screen is actually set up on the clinic headset & the home screen works.**

* Innovation Lab Specialist should click ‘Sync’ on the device’s page on ManageXR.
* Specialist will then ask the IT Rep if they are able to now view the home screen while wearing the headset.
* Once everything is finished, IT Rep should hand off the headset to a staff member to ensure it is sanitized.
