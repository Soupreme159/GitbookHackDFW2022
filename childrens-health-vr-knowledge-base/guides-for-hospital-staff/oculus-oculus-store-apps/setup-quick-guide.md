# Setup Quick Guide

Oculus How-To

**Set-Up**

1\. Charge your headset by using the charging cord included in the package

2\. Login to Oculus.com with a Facebook account [here](https://auth.oculus.com/login/?redirect\_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2F)

3\. If you do not already have a Facebook account, click “Sign-Up” underneath “Don’t have a Facebook account?”

4\. It’s important to know if you can successfully login to Oculus prior to setting up the headset

5\. Once your headset is charged, power it on by pressing and holding the power button until the light turns on (about 2-4secs)

6\. Once powered on, place the device on and begin the setup process in the VR system

7\. It will prompt you to remove the black pull tags from the bottom of each controller

8\. Once both are removed, you’ll see a laser pointer coming from each of your controllers and a blue button with an arrow will pop up; this is the ‘Next’ button

9\. Use the ‘Trigger’ button (the front button your pointer finger lays on) to select the ‘Next’ button; the Trigger button is what you’ll use to select every option during setup and when navigating through your headset

10\. Choose your language

11\. Adjust the headset as needed

12\. Select your WiFi; CHGuest does not work on these headsets. Use a sign-in required headset (e.g. CMCUser or RedBallon). When signing in to one of these networks, select “Do not validate” under “CA certificate” located just above identity. Enter your identity (shortened childrens username) and your password. You do not need to enter anonymous identity.

13\. Click “Done” when connected

14\. After the short video, click “Acknowledge” and allow your headset to update before proceeding

15\. When the update is complete, the headset will restart by powering off and turning back on

16\. The controllers themselves may not be fully updated yet, so if they do not appear when it powers back on please wait until they both finish; you’ll hear a noise prompt, and the controllers will vibrate when finished

17\. Once everything is updated and back online, you should see a pairing code. Finish the setup process through the mobile App after you see this pairing code (see Downloading the App section now)

18\. You’ll need to setup your Guardian (the safety boundary). First confirm the ‘Floor Level” by gently bring the ring part of the controller to the ground (see demonstration video included in headset). Now you can ‘Define your play area” either by drawing the boundary by clicking and holding the ‘Trigger’ button and making a full circle around you OR clicking “Switch to stationary boundary”; the stationary mode is designed for sitting. Once you’re happy with your boundary click “Confirm”

19\. You can reset your view by clicking and holding the ‘Oculus’ button (see demonstration video included in headset). The screen will center to the direction the headset is currently facing.

20\. All done!

**Downloading the App**

1\. You can download the Oculus app in the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Andriod) by searching for “Oculus” on your smartphone or tabet

2\. After you first login, the app will automatically ask you to pair a device. Allow the app to pair with your device. The app will start scanning for the pairing code displayed in your headset. Once paired, it will say “Headset Paired” and you can click the blue “Close” button.

3\. Return to Set-Up section, point number 18.

**Casting**

1\. Open the Oculus app on your phone or device

2\. Select in the top right of your screen.

3\. Select which headset you want to cast

4\. After selecting your headset, select what device you want to cast to

5\. It will automatically select the device you’re currently using and say “This Phone”. You can select other devices by using the drop down arrow on the far right of ‘This Phone’

6\. Tap the blue “Start” button at the bottom of your screen, put your headset on and accept the in-VR prompt to start casting (sometimes it automatically accepts this)

7\. You’ll see a yellow dot in the upper right of your headset’s screen indicating the current cast

8\. When you want to finish casting select “Stop Casting” in the bottom right of your phone or device; if it does not appear on screen, tap the middle of the screen once and it should appear.

9\. All done!
