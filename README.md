# Children's Health VR Knowledge Base

This Gitbook is responsible for winning the Quick Win award at the 2022 HackDFW Hackathon for Children's Health. The problem is stated below:


VR Knowledge Base - There is no internal/centralized Knowledge Base for all things VR that encompasses all processes involved in managing and using VR equipment at Children's. This would affect two types of groups - end users and those managing devices (IT dept). The challenge is to create a user-friendly resource guide that includes space to store process documents and training/user guides. The resources will include at least two buckets, managing devices (set up, management-ManageXR, creating new accounts - Meta, etc) and end users (how-to guides on using VR headsets for first timers)

By setting up a Gitbook, it allows for cloud storage as well as easy accessibility and a search bear allows for quick search. The merge function is similar to that of github, and allows for changes to be monitored in real time. The UI is good for both hospital staff and IT department. Editing, formatting and customization is easy to use and allows for lots of freedom to the users.
